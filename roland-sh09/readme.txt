Roland SH-09 samples, Bass drum pack

This is a collection of samples that I've made using a Roland SH-09,
an analog synthesizer from the 70's. All sounds were sampled in
16 bit 44.1 khz, mono directly from the synth without any
modifications or effects.

All samples are free of copyright. You may use them as you like.
